        <p>
          Hey! My name is Liam Henry, and I am presently pursuing a career as a web developer with the skills required to create simple yet creative and functional web pages, sites, and applications. Currently based in Durban, South Africa, I spend most of my time learning and growing as a developer.

              Providing support to students in the web development program at
              Umuzi (cohort C45), I assist the Learner experience coach by
              hosting daily stand up meetings and assisting the learners with
              any blockers or queries they may have. I also host problem solving
              sessions with some students once a week to work on problem solving
              skills for javascript
